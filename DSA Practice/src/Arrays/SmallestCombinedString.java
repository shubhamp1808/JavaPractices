// You are given an array A containing N strings. You will choose exactly one character from each string in A 
// and combine those characters in any order such that the resultant string K is lexicographically smallest.
// Find the string K.
// Notes:
// â€¢ A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where
// a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
// For example, "abcd" is lexicographically smaller than "abda" because the first position they differ is at 
// the third letter, and 'c' comes before 'd'.
