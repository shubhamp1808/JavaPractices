// You are given an array of integers, arr, of size array length. How many local extrema are there in arr?
// Definition of Local Extrema:
// The term "local extrema" refers to both local maximum values and local minimum values.
// An element in an array is categorized as a local maximum if its numerical value is greater than that of both 
// its neighbors (the element to the left and the element to the right).
// An element in an array is categorized as a local minimum if its numerical value is less than that of both 
// its neighbors (the element to the left and the element to the right).
// An element at either the start or end of an array CANNOT be a local maximum or a local minima as it has 
// just one neighbor.
